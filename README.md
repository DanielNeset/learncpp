## Information

This repository is used to learn c++ from following the INFT2503 course at NTNU.

## How to run

I am using a code editor called [juci++](https://gitlab.com/cppit/jucipp) to edit and run code. If you want to run code from this project you need to:

1. Clone this repository
2. Setup an enviroment to work with C++, i recomend juci++
3. Open juci++, select a folder and in the menu select 'compile and run'

For GUI you need to install gtkmm:
`brew install gtkmm3 `

Making templates lets you set a default template for a class or method, and can take in multiple types.

### 9 - STL Algorithms

Learning about some built in algorithms in c++, we can use on vectors.
